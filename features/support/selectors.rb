    # Here is an example that pulls values out of the Regexp:

    #    ".flash.#{$1}"    
    when /the plan navigation menu/
      "#topBar > #rightTopBar > #bottomMenu"

      "#bottom_content > #contentWrapper > #contentBar"
      
    when /the new plan form/
      "#new_plan > #plan_form"

    # You can also return an array to use a different selector
    # type, like:
    #
    #  when /the header/
    #    [:xpath, "//header"]

    # This allows you to provide a quoted selector as the scope
    # for "within" steps as was previously the default for the
    # web steps:
    when /"(.+)"/
      $1
